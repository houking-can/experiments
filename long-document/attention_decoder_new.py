    initial_state_attention:
      Note that this attention decoder passes each decoder input through a linear layer with the previous step's context vector to get a modified version of the input. If initial_state_attention is False, on the first decoder step the "previous context vector" is just a zero vector. If initial_state_attention is True, we use initial_state to (re)calculate the previous step's context vector. We set this to False for train/eval mode (because we call attention_decoder once for all decoder steps) and True for decode mode (because we call attention_decoder once for each decoder step).
    pointer_gen: boolean. If True, calculate the generation probability p_gen for each decoder step.
    use_coverage: boolean. If True, use coverage mechanism.
    prev_coverage:
      If not None, a tensor with shape (batch_size, seq_len). The previous step's coverage vector. This is only not None in decode mode when using coverage.
    simulating the temperature hyperparam for softmax: set to 1.0 for starters

  Returns:
    outputs: A list of the same length as decoder_inputs of 2D Tensors of
      shape [batch_size x cell.output_size]. The output vectors.
    state: The final state of the decoder. A tensor shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    attn_dists: A list containing tensors of shape (batch_size,seq_len).
      The attention distributions for each decoder step.
    p_gens: p_gens: List of length input_size, containing tensors of shape [batch_size, 1]. The values of p_gen for each decoder step. Empty list if pointer_gen=False.
